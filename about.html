    <h2>Women-Founded</h2>
    <p>Handmade by Em was founded by Emily, a young woman in her early twenties who works full-time in a pharmacy, while going to school for a second degree.  With the little free time she had, Emily started creating hair scrunchies, cosmetic bags, and tote bags, by watching Youtube tutorial videos on how to sew.</p>
